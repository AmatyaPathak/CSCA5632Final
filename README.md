# Final Project: Clustering Leukemia Variations Based on Gene Expression Data

<hr>

## 0: Project Objective

The objective of this project is to explore gene expression data for two types of cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Then, we will create supervised models to assign an unknown cancerous gene to the right category (class prediction), as well as unsupervised clustering models to sort a group of random cancerous genes into statistically significant categories (class discovery).
